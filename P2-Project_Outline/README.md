### Overview
The name of the project is Last Live Leg Trade Board or 3LTB, for short. The idea originated with a group member who is a flight attendant. In his company, flight attendants are currently capable of trading work assignments in their entirety, but the application in place does not accommodate the trading of separate legs of a trip among the employees. This application will provide the ability to do just that.
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Posting: An authenticated user will be able to post flight legs he wishes to drop.
Bidding: An authenticated user can pick up other flight attendant's assignment that is of interest to him.
Trading: An authenticated user can trade flight assignments with other employees.
